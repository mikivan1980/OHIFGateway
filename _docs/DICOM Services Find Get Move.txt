C.1.4 Service Definition
Two peer DICOM AEs implement a SOP Class of the Query/Retrieve Service Class with 
one serving in the SCU role and one serving in the SCP role. 
SOP Classes of the Query/Retrieve Service Class are implemented using the DIMSE-C C-FIND, 
C-MOVE, and C- GET services as defined in PS3.7.
Both a baseline and extended behavior is defined for the DIMSE-C C-FIND, 
C-MOVE, and C-GET services. Baseline behavior specifies a minimum level of conformance for 
all implementations to facilitate interoperability. 
Extended behavior enhances the baseline behavior to provide additional features that may be negotiated 
independently at Association establishment time.
